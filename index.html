            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Mohammad Amini, a Ph.D. student currently studying Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Florida. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Amirkabir University of Technology and a Master's degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering from Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, Iran. During my master's studies, I worked under the guidance of Dr. Kourosh Eshghi, where I focused on the application of mathematical programming in graceful and alpha valuation for quadratic graphs. After completing my master's degree, I decided to pursue a Ph.D. in the United States, and I began my doctoral studies at the University of Texas at Austin. While at UT Austin, I worked on game theory and its application in sustainable operations research. Currently, I am working on multimodal data fusion for decentralized datasets under the supervision of Dr. Mostafa Reisi and Dr. Aleksandr Kazachkov at the University of Florida. My research interests include optimization, data analysis, Global Optimization, and their applications in various fields.</p>
